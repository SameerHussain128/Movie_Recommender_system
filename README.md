# Movie_Recommender_systerm

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a content-based Movie Recommender System that suggests movies to users based on their input. By analyzing the characteristics of movies such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew, the system provides personalized recommendations to enhance the user experience.

Goal
* Develop a system that can recommend similar movies to a user-selected movie.
* Provide an intuitive interface using Streamlit to make the recommendations accessible.
* Enhance user engagement by displaying movie posters along with recommendations for a visually appealing experience.
  
Description
The Movie Recommender System leverages a content-based filtering approach:

* It extracts important features like genres, keywords, cast, crew, and movie overviews from a movie dataset.
* These features are combined into a single "tag" for each movie, which is processed and stemmed to standardize the data.
* Using cosine similarity, the system identifies and ranks movies that are most similar to the user's selected movie.
  
Key technologies used:

Python: Core logic and data processing.
Streamlit: Frontend development for deploying the application.
Pickle: To store precomputed similarity matrices and datasets.
TMDb API / OMDb API: To fetch movie posters dynamically.

Result
A user-friendly web application that:
Allows users to select or type a movie title.
Provides 5 recommended movies based on similarity scores.
Displays high-quality movie posters alongside recommendations.
The system successfully combines machine learning techniques with modern web development tools to deliver an engaging and useful movie recommendation platform.
